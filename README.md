# CS340-Project2 Reflections and Insights

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project exemplifies maintainable and readable code through modularity and clear documentation. The Python CRUD module separates database logic from the dashboard, making it easy to test, debug, and expand. The use of functions with descriptive names and comments enhances code readability and adaptability.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

The project required analyzing the requirements of the Grazioso Salvare organization and designing a solution that met their needs for scalability and efficiency. By breaking the problem into smaller tasks—such as setting up the database schema, implementing CRUD operations, and connecting to the dashboard—I applied a structured problem-solving approach. This process mirrors real-world practices and demonstrates how computer scientists solve complex challenges.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists design and implement solutions that improve processes, automate tasks, and provide insights. This project highlights the importance of managing data efficiently. The system allows companies like Grazioso Salvare to retrieve and analyze data quickly, enabling them to focus on their core goals. Computer scientists enable organizations to make data-driven decisions, ultimately improving productivity and success.
